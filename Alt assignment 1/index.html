        Altschool has been an institution i've taken interest in for the past
        two years, <br />
        i've been carefully following the program and seeing how much value you
        guys provide to your students and <br />
        the way the teaching is being done has always fascinated me ,making sure
        that each and <br />
        everyone can learn at their pace while striving for the goal of breaking
        into the tech industry. <br />
        That resonated quite well with and i didn't hesitate when the
        opportuinity arose this year to be part of this illustrous program.

        My goal in the altschool program is to improve and grow as a software
        engineer both techincally and stylistically, <br> become a well rounded
        employable software engineer, develop intrinsic values that would be
        desirable to future employees <br> and overall be a better human being on
        this little rock of our's called earth. <br> I plan on making lasting
        connections with both the students and the tutors and adding to ever
        growing list of friends and company.
